 Game Engine - [ ] Separate game logic from React components - [ ] Track game state (board, current player, etc.) - [ ] Allow users to calculate moves - [ ] Handle move validation - [ ] Detect win/lose/draw conditions
 Frontend/React Game Interface - [ ] Display current game state - [ ] Allow players to make moves by using the game engine - [ ] Show game status (whose turn, winner, etc.) - [ ] Reset/restart game functionality
Bonus:

 [Styling] - Make it look sexy. Add animations for game moves (react-spring, framer, keyframes)
 [Routing] - Multiple pages with navigation: - [ ] Start/menu page with game mode selection (Player vs Player, Player vs AI) - [ ] Game page for active gameplay
 [Algorithms] - Player vs AI modes: start with random moves, then implement minimax or other algorithms for calculating optimal moves
