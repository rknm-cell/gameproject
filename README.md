 Game Engine - 
 [x] Separate game logic from React components - 
 [x] Track game state (board, current player, etc.) - 
 [x] Allow users to calculate moves - 
 [x] Handle move validation - 
 [x] Detect win/lose/draw conditions

 Frontend/React Game Interface - 
 [x] Display current game state - 
 [x] Allow players to make moves by using the game engine - 
 [x] Show game status (whose turn, winner, etc.) - 
 [x] Reset/restart game functionality
Bonus:

 [Styling] - Make it look sexy. Add animations for game moves (react-spring, framer, keyframes)
 [Routing] - Multiple pages with navigation: - [ ] Start/menu page with game mode selection (Player vs Player, Player vs AI) - [ ] Game page for active gameplay
 [Algorithms] - Player vs AI modes: start with random moves, then implement minimax or other algorithms for calculating optimal moves
